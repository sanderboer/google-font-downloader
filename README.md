# Font Downloader

A CLI to find and download Google Fonts. It consolidates TTF/OTF/TTC from the family ZIP or the google/fonts repo, adds all available WOFF/WOFF2 weights via the CSS2 API, writes OFL.txt, and generates an SCSS snippet.

## Installation

From PyPI (recommended):
```bash
pip install fontdownloader
```

From source (development):
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Commands

### Search
```bash
fontdownloader search "Roboto"
```

### Download one or more families (consolidated)
```bash
# Single
fontdownloader download "Roboto" --force

# Multiple
fontdownloader download "Inter" "Roboto" "Lora"

# From file (one name per line)
fontdownloader download --file fonts.txt
```
- Downloads TTF/OTF/TTC + OFL.txt (ZIP first, repo fallback)
- Adds all WOFF/WOFF2 weights (100â€“900, normal/italic) via CSS2
- Writes SCSS to `assets/scss/<Family>.scss`
- Outputs files under `assets/fonts/<Family>/`

### Generate SCSS only
```bash
fontdownloader generate-scss "Roboto"
```
- Regenerates `assets/scss/Roboto.scss` based on current files in `assets/fonts/Roboto/`

## Output
- `assets/fonts/<Family>/`: TTF/OTF/TTC and WOFF/WOFF2 files, plus `OFL.txt`
- `assets/scss/<Family>.scss`: @font-face rules for downloaded variants

## Notes
- No API key required. If the ZIP is blocked, the tool falls back to the google/fonts GitHub repo for TTF/OTF/TTC.
- Optional: set a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to raise GitHub API rate limits.
- The `assets/` directory is ignored by git by default.
